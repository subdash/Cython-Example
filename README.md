# Cython vs Python profiling example

### Two implementations of an algorithm to find out if two strings are permutations of each other. One is in pure Python while the other calls C functions from Python and is compiled with Cython.

### To build, run the build.sh script. To test, run the time_executions.sh script. This requires Python3.
